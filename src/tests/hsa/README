These tests are meant for properly configuring and testing HSA (High Service
Availability) for our Matahari agents.

Setup:
cp fixtures/var/named/* -> /var/named/.
chown root.named /var/named/*

cp fixtures/etc/named.* /etc/.
chown root.named /etc/named.conf
chown root.named /etc/name.rfc1912.zones 

service named restart

Create 3 ip's:
ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.40
ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.41
ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.42

Replace eth0 with your interface.

Add this to /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1		localhost.localdomain localhost matahariproject.org matahariproject
::1		localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6
192.168.0.40 	qpid
192.168.0.41 	qpid2
192.168.0.42 	qpid3

Make sure you have an entry for nameserver pointing to 127.0.0.1

# Generated by NetworkManager
search kooba
nameserver 127.0.0.1
# These can be removed if you've added these in the options { forwarders {}; }; 
# section of named.conf
nameserver 209.18.47.61
nameserver 209.18.47.62

Test SRV records with:
host -t srv _matahari._tcp.matahariproject.org

_matahari._tcp.matahariproject.org has SRV record 0 2 49000 qpid2.matahariproject.org.
_matahari._tcp.matahariproject.org has SRV record 0 3 49000 qpid.matahariproject.org.
_matahari._tcp.matahariproject.org has SRV record 0 1 49000 qpid3.matahariproject.org.
