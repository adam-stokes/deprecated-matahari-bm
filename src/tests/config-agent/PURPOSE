Description: Test if a config agent responds to event handler
Author: Adam Stokes <astokes@fedoraproject.org>

This tests makes sure that when the config agent connects to the broker we are
able to determine if a configuration file is set in order to let the broker
know whether or not this is a new agent/system or this system is already configured.
