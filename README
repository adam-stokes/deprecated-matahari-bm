QMF System Agent

To build, you need a copy of Apache QPID (http://qpid.apache.org/) checked out
and built. Following this, run a make install of QPID.

To build the system agent:
./configure --with-boost-regex=mt
make

To test, run qpidd followed by the executable built by this project. qpid-tool
from the qpid project is a quick and easy way to manipulate the functionality
exposed by this agent.
