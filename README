QMF System Agent

To build the system agent:
./autogen.sh
./configure
make rpm

The resulting rpm can then be installed.

To test, ensure the qpidd service is running. Then, run the matahari service
(defaults to port 5672 on 127.0.0.1 with no authentication). qpid-tool
from the qpid project is a quick and easy way to manipulate the functionality
exposed by this agent.

Edit parameters passed to the script by editing the corresponding sysconfig file,
or by running from the command line.
