QMF System Agent

To build, you need a copy of Apache QPID (http://qpid.apache.org/) checked out
and built. Modify the makefile to point to the directory of the checked out
and built qpid branch, and then type make to compile this project.

To test, run qpidd followed by the executable built by this project. qpid-tool
from the qpid project is a quick and easy way to manipulate the functionality
exposed by this agent.
